CRITICAL TASK: Analyze this initial story idea and extract the key elements EXACTLY as they appear:

"{{ initial_idea }}"

Extract and structure the following elements as they appear in the idea:
1. Setting - The primary location or environment where the story takes place (e.g., "small northern German coastal village")
2. Characters - The key individuals or entities in the story with their roles or descriptions (e.g., "old fisherman detective")
3. Plot - The main problem, challenge, or storyline (e.g., "figuring out who stole the statue from the fish market")
4. Themes - Any specific themes or motifs mentioned
5. Genre elements - Any specific genre elements that should be emphasized (e.g., "hard boiled detective story")

Be EXTREMELY precise and faithful to the original idea. Do not substitute, generalize, or omit elements.
If the idea explicitly mentions a setting, character, or plot element, you MUST include it exactly as stated.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the idea
- Do NOT infer, assume, or add elements not mentioned
- Preserve exact wording and specificity
- If something isn't mentioned, leave that field minimal
- NEVER replace specific details with generic ones
