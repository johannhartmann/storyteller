Create a compelling story outline for a {{ tone }} {{ genre }} narrative using a circular structure.
{% if initial_idea %}This story should be based on this initial idea: '{{ initial_idea }}'{% endif %}

Structure your outline so the ending mirrors the beginning with crucial transformation:

## OPENING: THE FIRST ITERATION (20% of the story)
**Purpose:** Establish the recurring situation and initial perspective

1. **Opening Scene** - A specific moment/situation that will echo at the end
2. **Initial Worldview** - How the protagonist sees their reality
3. **The Pattern** - Established routines, beliefs, or cycles
4. **Moment of Disruption** - Something breaks the pattern
5. **Choice to Journey** - Decision that starts the transformation

## JOURNEY OUTWARD: LEAVING THE KNOWN (30% of the story)
**Purpose:** Move away from the familiar into new experiences

6. **Departing the Familiar** - Physical or metaphorical journey begins
7. **New Perspectives** - Encountering different ways of being
8. **Challenges to Beliefs** - Core assumptions questioned
9. **Accumulating Experiences** - Gathering new knowledge/skills
10. **Relationships Transform** - Connections that change the protagonist
11. **Point of No Return** - Can't go back to old ways of thinking

## THE TRANSFORMATION: FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (30% of the story)
**Purpose:** Core shift in understanding or being

12. **Crisis of Identity** - Who am I becoming?
13. **Shedding the Old** - Letting go of past limitations
14. **The Revelation** - Understanding what must change
15. **Integration** - Combining old and new selves
16. **Testing the Change** - Proving the transformation is real
17. **New Wisdom** - What the protagonist now knows

## RETURN: THE FINAL ITERATION (20% of the story)
**Purpose:** Return to the beginning situation, utterly transformed

18. **Approaching the Familiar** - Coming back to where we started
19. **Same Scene, New Eyes** - The opening situation revisited
20. **Others Unchanged** - The world is the same, protagonist different
21. **The Choice Revisited** - Same decision, different response
22. **Ripple Effects** - How the change affects everything
23. **New Cycle Begins** - The next iteration starts from wisdom

Key Elements for Circular Structure:
- **The Mirror Scenes**: Opening and closing scenes that are nearly identical in setup but completely different in meaning
- **The Central Image/Symbol**: Something that appears throughout, changing meaning
- **The Repeated Question**: A question asked at beginning and end with different answers
- **The Transformation Marker**: Clear evidence of internal change

For each section, ensure that:
- Every element in the opening has a transformed echo in the ending
- The journey justifies the transformation
- The circular structure enhances rather than limits the story
- Readers feel the satisfaction of return and recognition

Also include:
- Title: [Something that captures the cyclical nature]
- Main Characters: Focus on 2-3 characters to allow deep transformation
- Central Question: What understanding must be gained?
- Setting: A place that remains constant while meaning changes
- Themes: Ideas about cycles, change, perception, time
- Symbols: Recurring elements that gain meaning

{% if idea_elements %}
KEY ELEMENTS TO INCORPORATE:
- Setting: {{ idea_elements.setting }}

  * Show how the same place can feel completely different

- Characters: {{ idea_elements.characters | join(', ') }}
  * Focus on internal transformation
  * Show how relationships recontextualize

- Plot: {{ idea_elements.plot }}
  * Frame as a journey of understanding
  * Use circular structure to deepen meaning

- Themes: {{ idea_elements.themes | join(', ') }}

ESSENTIAL: The circular structure must:
- Create a satisfying sense of completion
- Show genuine transformation, not mere repetition
- Use the return to measure how far we've come
- Leave readers with a sense of profound recognition
