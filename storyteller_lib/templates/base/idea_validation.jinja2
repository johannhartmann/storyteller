{# Base template for idea validation - English version #}
VALIDATION: Evaluate whether this story outline effectively incorporates the initial story idea:

Initial Idea: "{{ initial_idea }}"

Key Elements to Check:
- Setting: {{ setting }}
- Characters: {{ characters | join(', ') }}
- Plot: {{ plot }}
{% if themes %}
- Themes: {{ themes | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}
{% if genre_elements %}
- Genre Elements: {{ genre_elements | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}

Story Outline:
{{ story_outline }}

Evaluate:
1. Does the outline properly incorporate the specified setting?
2. Are all mentioned characters included with their specified roles?
3. Does the main plot follow the initial idea?
4. Are the themes (if any) woven into the narrative?
5. Does it maintain the genre elements specified?

Provide:
- A score from 1-10 for adherence to the initial idea
- Specific examples of successful incorporation
- Any elements that were omitted or changed
- Recommendations for better alignment if needed

CRITICAL: The initial idea is the foundation - deviations should only enhance, not replace core elements.

VALIDATION FOCUS:
- Setting must match exactly (no substitutions)
- Characters must retain their specified roles
- Core plot must remain intact
- Enhancements are welcome but not at the expense of the original
- Genre consistency throughout
