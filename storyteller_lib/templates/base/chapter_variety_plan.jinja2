{# Base template for chapter variety planning - English version #}
Create a detailed scene-by-scene plan for Chapter {{ chapter_number }} that ensures variety and progression.

CHAPTER OUTLINE:
{{ chapter_outline }}

AVAILABLE CHARACTERS:
{{ available_characters }}

PLOT THREADS TO ADVANCE:
{{ plot_threads }}

{% if previous_patterns %}
AVOID THESE PATTERNS FROM PREVIOUS CHAPTERS:
{{ previous_patterns }}
{% endif %}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each scene must have a DIFFERENT structure and purpose
2. Vary the locations - don't keep characters in the same place
3. Rotate which characters appear - don't use the same group every scene
4. Each scene type should be different (action, dialogue, exploration, etc.)
5. Vary emotional tones throughout the chapter
6. Each scene must meaningfully advance at least one plot thread

{% if chapter_number == 1 %}
For Chapter 1 specifically:
- Scene 1 can establish routine/normal world
- Remaining scenes must show PROGRESSION and CHANGE
- Avoid multiple "vision/anomaly" scenes
- Show different aspects of the world and character
{% endif %}

Create 3-5 scenes that form a complete chapter arc while maintaining variety.

SCENE PLANNING GUIDELINES:
- Each scene should have a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Transitions between scenes should feel natural
- Character motivations should drive scene progression
- Environmental details should support the scene's purpose
- Pacing should vary between scenes
