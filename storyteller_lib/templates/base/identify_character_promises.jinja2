{# Base template for identifying character promises - English version #}
Analyze this {{ genre }} story outline with {{ tone }} tone to identify promises (implicit and explicit) made about each character's journey.

STORY OUTLINE:
{{ story_outline }}

CHARACTERS:
{{ characters }}

Identify promises made about each character, including:
1. Growth arcs promised (e.g., "coward becomes brave", "loner finds family")
2. Revelations hinted at (e.g., hidden past, true identity)
3. Relationship developments suggested
4. Skills or abilities to be gained/lost
5. Internal conflicts to be resolved

Consider {{ genre }} genre conventions:
- Fantasy often promises power growth or destiny fulfillment
- Mystery promises revelations about character connections
- Romance promises relationship resolution
- Literary fiction may promise subtle internal changes
- Thriller promises character testing under pressure

For each promise, note:
- Which character it concerns
- What type of promise it is
- When it was introduced (if clear from outline)
- When it might be expected to resolve (early/middle/late/ongoing)

Remember: Not all characters need dramatic arcs. Some serve as stable anchors, which is also a valid "promise" to readers.
