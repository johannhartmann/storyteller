## YOUR TASK

Compare what was written against both the book-level style guide and scene-specific requirements. Analyze whether the scene successfully:

1. Maintains the established writing style and tone
2. Accomplishes all required plot progressions and character development
3. Connects properly with previous scenes and sets up future ones
4. Engages the reader with quality prose
5. Avoids forbidden repetitions and maintains variety

Focus on CRITICAL issues that would confuse readers or break story continuity. Minor style variations are acceptable if the core requirements are met.

Provide your analysis in the structured format requested.
