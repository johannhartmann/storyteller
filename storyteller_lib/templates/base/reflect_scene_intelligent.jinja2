## YOUR TASK

Compare what was written against both the book-level style guide and scene-specific requirements. Analyze whether the scene successfully:

1. Maintains the established writing style and tone
2. Accomplishes all required plot progressions and character development
3. Connects properly with previous scenes and sets up future ones
4. Engages the reader with quality prose
5. Avoids forbidden repetitions and maintains variety

## STYLE ANALYSIS - PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO:

**Word Repetition**: Check each paragraph for overuse of the same words or word roots. For example:
- Using "red/reddish/redness" multiple times in close proximity
- Repeating the same noun (like "door", "stone", "plate") excessively within a paragraph
- Using similar adjectives redundantly (like "faded" and "pale" together)

**Phrase Repetition**: Look for:
- Similar sentence structures repeated in succession
- Overuse of specific phrases or constructions
- Repetitive action patterns (e.g., "he looked", "his gaze fell", "he glanced")

**Redundant Descriptions**: Identify:
- Multiple descriptions of the same object that don't add new information
- Adjectives that mean the same thing used together
- Unnecessary restatements of established facts

## ISSUE CATEGORIZATION

Distinguish between:
- CRITICAL ISSUES: Problems that confuse readers, break story continuity, contradict established facts, or severely damage the scene (these require full revision)
- STYLE ISSUES: Word repetition, redundant descriptions, awkward phrasing, or other prose-level problems that can be fixed with targeted corrections
- MINOR ISSUES: Small inconsistencies, slight improvements, or minor enhancements

Be specific about which issues are critical vs style-related vs minor. Only mark needs_revision=true for critical issues that require a complete rewrite.

For style issues (especially word repetition), provide specific examples with the repeated words/phrases and their locations.

Provide your analysis in the structured format requested.
