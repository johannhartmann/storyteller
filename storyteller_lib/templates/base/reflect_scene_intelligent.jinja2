## YOUR TASK

Compare what was written against both the book-level style guide and scene-specific requirements. Analyze whether the scene successfully:

1. Maintains the established writing style and tone
2. Accomplishes all required plot progressions and character development
3. Connects properly with previous scenes and sets up future ones
4. Engages the reader with quality prose
5. Avoids forbidden repetitions and maintains variety

Distinguish between:
- CRITICAL ISSUES: Problems that confuse readers, break story continuity, or severely damage the scene (these require full revision)
- MINOR ISSUES: Small inconsistencies, minor phrasing problems, or slight improvements that could enhance the scene without major rewriting

Be specific about which issues are critical vs minor. Only mark needs_revision=true for critical issues.

Provide your analysis in the structured format requested.
