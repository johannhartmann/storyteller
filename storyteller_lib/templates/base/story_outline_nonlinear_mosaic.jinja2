Create a compelling story outline for a {{ tone }} {{ genre }} narrative using a nonlinear/mosaic structure.
{% if initial_idea %}This story should be based on this initial idea: '{{ initial_idea }}'{% endif %}

Structure your outline as interconnected vignettes that reveal the full story through patterns:

## VIGNETTE GROUPS
Organize your story into 4-6 thematic groupings, each containing multiple vignettes:

### GROUP 1: INTRODUCTION FRAGMENTS (20% of story)
**Purpose:** Establish mystery, introduce perspectives, create questions

Vignettes should:
- Present different viewpoints of the same world/situation
- Introduce characters without full context
- Create compelling mysteries that demand answers
- Establish tone and atmosphere
- Plant seeds that will bloom in later vignettes

### GROUP 2: DEEPENING CONNECTIONS (30% of story)
**Purpose:** Begin revealing how vignettes connect

Vignettes should:
- Show same events from different angles
- Reveal hidden connections between characters
- Deepen mysteries while answering some questions
- Introduce temporal jumps or perspective shifts
- Build thematic resonance between seemingly unrelated events

### GROUP 3: REVELATION PATTERNS (30% of story)
**Purpose:** Major connections become clear

Vignettes should:
- Reveal the true chronology or relationship structure
- Show how individual stories form a larger narrative
- Provide "aha" moments that recontextualize earlier vignettes
- Accelerate the pace of revelations
- Build toward the unified understanding

### GROUP 4: SYNTHESIS (20% of story)
**Purpose:** All pieces come together

Vignettes should:
- Complete the mosaic picture
- Resolve the central mystery/question
- Show the full impact of interconnections
- Provide emotional/thematic resolution
- Leave some ambiguity for reader interpretation

## VIGNETTE SPECIFICATIONS
For each vignette, specify:
1. **Title/Timestamp**: When/where this piece occurs
2. **POV Character**: Whose perspective we follow
3. **Content**: What happens in this fragment
4. **Connections**: How it relates to other vignettes
5. **Reveals**: What new information it provides
6. **Questions**: What mysteries it creates or deepens

## CONNECTING ELEMENTS
Identify the threads that weave through all vignettes:
- **Central Mystery/Question**: What puzzle are we solving?
- **Recurring Symbols/Objects**: Items that appear across vignettes
- **Thematic Echoes**: Ideas that resonate between fragments
- **Temporal Structure**: How time works in your mosaic
- **Spatial Connections**: Locations that link vignettes

Also include:
- Title: [Something that hints at the mosaic nature]
- POV Characters: 4-6 perspectives that offer different pieces
- Central Question: What the mosaic reveals when complete
- Setting: Location(s) that can support multiple viewpoints
- Themes: Ideas best explored through fragmentation
- Mood: How {{ tone }} atmosphere enhances the mosaic

CRITICAL FOR MOSAIC STRUCTURE:
- Each vignette must be compelling on its own
- The pattern must emerge gradually, not be forced
- Readers should experience discovery, not confusion
- The complete picture must be worth the journey
- Some connections should be subtle, requiring reader participation
