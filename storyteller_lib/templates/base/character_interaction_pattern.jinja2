{# Base template for character interaction pattern analysis - English version #}
Analyze the interactions between {{ character1 }} and {{ character2 }} across these scenes:

{% for interaction in interactions %}
- {{ interaction }}
{% endfor %}

Determine:
1. Is there a repetitive pattern in how these characters interact?
2. Does the dynamic between them evolve or remain static?
3. Would varying their interaction pattern improve the story?

Common repetitive patterns to look for:
- Same power dynamic every time (one dominant, one submissive)
- Same emotional beats (conflict → resolution → understanding)
- Same roles (one always helps, other always needs help)
- Same conversation topics or concerns
- Same locations or circumstances for meetings

Consider:
- Character growth should affect relationships
- Variety in interaction keeps readers engaged
- Some consistency is good for character voice
- Change should feel earned, not arbitrary
