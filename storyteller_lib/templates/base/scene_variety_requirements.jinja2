{# Base template for determining scene variety requirements - English version #}
Based on the previous scenes and chapter outline, determine variety requirements for the next scene:

PREVIOUS SCENES:
{% for scene in scene_history %}
Scene {{ loop.index }}:
- Type: {{ scene.scene_type }}
- Structure: {{ scene.structure }}
- Characters: {{ scene.characters | join(', ') }}
- Events: {{ scene.events | join(', ') }}
{% endfor %}

CHAPTER OUTLINE:
{{ chapter_outline }}

CURRENT POSITION:
- Scene {{ scene_number }} of {{ total_scenes_in_chapter }}
- Chapter progress: {{ ((scene_number - 1) / total_scenes_in_chapter * 100) | round }}%

VARIETY ANALYSIS:

1. SCENE TYPE REQUIREMENT:
Looking at recent scene types, determine what type would provide maximum variety:
- action: Physical conflict, chase, or combat
- dialogue: Character conversation and interaction  
- exploration: Discovery, investigation, or world-building
- revelation: Major plot or character revelation
- transition: Movement between locations or time periods
- character_moment: Internal reflection or character development

2. SETTING VARIETY:
Should the setting change from the previous scene? Consider:
- Have we spent too long in one location?
- Would a setting change enhance the story?
- Does the plot require a new location?

3. CHARACTER MIX:
- Which characters have been overused recently?
- Which characters need more screen time?
- Would introducing new character combinations create interest?

4. ELEMENTS TO AVOID:
Based on recent repetition, what should we avoid?
- Overused plot devices
- Repetitive character actions
- Similar emotional beats
- Recurring imagery or symbols

5. PLOT THREAD SELECTION:
Which plot thread needs attention?
- Consider threads that haven't been addressed recently
- Balance major and minor threads
- Ensure progression toward chapter goals

6. PERSPECTIVE FOCUS:
Whose viewpoint would be most fresh?
- Characters who haven't had focus recently
- Perspectives that reveal new information
- Viewpoints that create contrast

7. EMOTIONAL VARIETY:
What emotional tone would create contrast?
- tense: High stakes, danger, urgency
- calm: Peaceful, reflective, restorative
- mysterious: Enigmatic, uncertain, questioning
- hopeful: Optimistic, forward-looking
- dark: Ominous, threatening, despairing

REQUIREMENTS:
Generate specific requirements that will:
