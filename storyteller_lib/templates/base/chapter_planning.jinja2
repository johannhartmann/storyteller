Based on this story outline:

{{ global_story }}

And these characters:

{{ characters }}

Create a plan for 8-15 chapters that cover the entire hero's journey for this {{ tone }} {{ genre }} story.
IMPORTANT: THERE SHOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN 8 CHAPTERS. A COMPLETE STORY REQUIRES AT LEAST 8 CHAPTERS TO PROPERLY DEVELOP.

For each chapter, provide:
1. Chapter number and title
2. A summary of major events (200-300 words)
3. Which characters appear and how they develop
4. For each of the 3-6 key scenes, specify:
   - Brief description of what happens
   - Plot progressions: What key plot points are revealed/advanced (e.g., "hero_learns_about_quest", "villain_revealed")
   - Character knowledge changes: What each character learns in this scene
   - Required characters: Which characters MUST appear
   - Prerequisites: What must have already happened before this scene
5. Any major revelations or plot twists

CRITICAL: Be very specific about plot progressions. Instead of generic descriptions like "character development", use specific keys like:
- "felix_learns_pen_missing" (not just "plot introduction")
- "hero_accepts_quest" (not just "character decision")
- "mentor_reveals_secret" (not just "revelation")

This specificity prevents repetition and ensures proper story progression.

Ensure the chapters flow logically and maintain the arc of the hero's journey.

CHAPTER PLANNING GUIDELINES:
- Balance action and character development
- Ensure each chapter advances the plot
- Include both major and minor conflicts
- Build tension progressively

- Vary chapter focus and pacing

HERO'S JOURNEY DISTRIBUTION:
- Chapters 1-2: Ordinary World & Call to Adventure
