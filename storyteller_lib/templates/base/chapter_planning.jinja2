Based on this story outline:

{{ global_story }}

And these characters:

{{ characters }}

Create a plan for 8-15 chapters that cover the entire hero's journey for this {{ tone }} {{ genre }} story.
IMPORTANT: THERE SHOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN 8 CHAPTERS. A COMPLETE STORY REQUIRES AT LEAST 8 CHAPTERS TO PROPERLY DEVELOP.

For each chapter, provide:
1. Chapter number and title
2. A summary of major events (200-300 words)
3. Which characters appear and how they develop
4. IMPORTANT: Create 3-6 key scenes per chapter (NEVER less than 3, aim for 4-5 for good pacing). For each scene, specify:
   - Brief description of what happens
   - Scene type: Choose from (action, dialogue, exploration, revelation, character_moment, transition, conflict, resolution)
   - Plot progressions: What key plot points are revealed/advanced (e.g., "hero_learns_about_quest", "villain_revealed")
   - Character learns: List what characters learn, formatted as "CharacterName: what they learn"
   - Required characters: Which characters MUST appear
   - Forbidden repetitions: What plot points must NOT be repeated from earlier scenes
   - Dramatic purpose: The scene's role (setup, rising_action, climax, falling_action, resolution)
   - Tension level: Rate 1-10 (1=calm, 10=maximum tension)
   - Ends with: How the scene concludes (cliffhanger, resolution, soft_transition, hard_break)
   - Connects to next: How this scene leads into the next one
5. Any major revelations or plot twists

CRITICAL: Be very specific about plot progressions. Instead of generic descriptions like "character development", use specific keys like:
- "felix_learns_pen_missing" (not just "plot introduction")
- "hero_accepts_quest" (not just "character decision")
- "mentor_reveals_secret" (not just "revelation")

This specificity prevents repetition and ensures proper story progression.

Ensure the chapters flow logically and maintain the arc of the hero's journey.

CHAPTER PLANNING GUIDELINES:
- Balance action and character development
- Ensure each chapter advances the plot
- Include both major and minor conflicts
- Build tension progressively
- Plant setups for later payoffs
- Vary chapter focus and pacing

DRAMATIC FLOW GUIDELINES:
- Each scene should have a clear dramatic purpose in the chapter's arc
- Tension should generally rise toward chapter climax, then resolve
- Scene breaks should be motivated by dramatic shifts, not arbitrary divisions
- Use hard breaks (new scenes) for major shifts in tension, time, or location
- Use soft transitions when dramatic purpose continues
- Cliffhangers should appear at strategic points, not every scene
- Consider merging scenes that share the same dramatic purpose and tension level

HERO'S JOURNEY DISTRIBUTION:
- Chapters 1-2: Ordinary World & Call to Adventure
- Chapters 3-4: Refusal & Meeting the Mentor
- Chapters 5-6: Crossing Threshold & Tests
- Chapters 7-9: Approach & Ordeal
- Chapters 10-12: Reward & Road Back
- Chapters 13-15: Resurrection & Return

Adapt this structure to fit your specific story needs while maintaining the journey arc.
