Based on this story outline:

{{ global_story }}

And these characters:

{{ characters }}

Create a plan for {{ target_chapters }} chapters ({% if flexibility %}with flexibility of Â±{{ flexibility }} chapters if needed{% endif %}) that cover the entire story arc for this {{ tone }} {{ genre }} story.
The narrative structure is: {{ narrative_structure | replace('_', ' ') | title }}
{% if min_chapters %}IMPORTANT: THERE SHOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN {{ min_chapters }} CHAPTERS to properly develop the story.{% endif %}

For each chapter, provide:
1. Chapter number and title
2. A summary of major events (200-300 words)
3. Which characters appear and how they develop
4. IMPORTANT: Create 3-6 key scenes per chapter (NEVER less than 3, aim for 4-5 for good pacing). For each scene, specify:
   - Brief description of what happens
   - Scene type: Choose from (action, dialogue, exploration, revelation, character_moment, transition, conflict, resolution)
   - Plot progressions: What key plot points are revealed/advanced (e.g., "hero_learns_about_quest", "villain_revealed")
   - Character learns: List what characters learn, formatted as "CharacterName: what they learn"
   - Required characters: Which characters MUST appear
   - Forbidden repetitions: What plot points must NOT be repeated from earlier scenes
   - Dramatic purpose: The scene's role (setup, rising_action, climax, falling_action, resolution)
   - Tension level: Rate 1-10 (1=calm, 10=maximum tension)
   - Ends with: How the scene concludes (cliffhanger, resolution, soft_transition, hard_break)
   - Connects to next: How this scene leads into the next one
5. Any major revelations or plot twists

CRITICAL: Be very specific about plot progressions. Instead of generic descriptions like "character development", use specific keys like:
- "felix_learns_pen_missing" (not just "plot introduction")
- "hero_accepts_quest" (not just "character decision")
- "mentor_reveals_secret" (not just "revelation")

This specificity prevents repetition and ensures proper story progression.

Ensure the chapters flow logically and maintain the arc of the hero's journey.

CHAPTER PLANNING GUIDELINES:
- Balance action and character development
- Ensure each chapter advances the plot
- Include both major and minor conflicts
- Build tension progressively
- Plant setups for later payoffs
- Vary chapter focus and pacing

DRAMATIC FLOW GUIDELINES:
- Each scene should have a clear dramatic purpose in the chapter's arc
- Tension should generally rise toward chapter climax, then resolve
- Scene breaks should be motivated by dramatic shifts, not arbitrary divisions
- Use hard breaks (new scenes) for major shifts in tension, time, or location
- Use soft transitions when dramatic purpose continues
- Cliffhangers should appear at strategic points, not every scene
- Consider merging scenes that share the same dramatic purpose and tension level
