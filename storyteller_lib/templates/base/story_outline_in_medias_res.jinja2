Structure your outline to begin in the middle of action:

## OPENING ACTION SEQUENCE (10% of the story)
**Purpose:** Hook readers with immediate high-stakes action

1. **Cold Open** - Start at a crucial moment of danger/tension
2. **Immediate Stakes** - What's at risk right now
3. **Character Under Pressure** - Protagonist in action, revealing character
4. **Cliffhanger Pause** - Leave the action unresolved

## FLASHBACK: HOW WE GOT HERE (30% of the story)
**Purpose:** Provide context while maintaining narrative momentum

5. **Time Jump Marker** - Clear transition to the past
6. **Original Status Quo** - Where the protagonist started
7. **Seeds of Conflict** - Early signs of trouble
8. **Escalating Events** - The chain of events leading to opening
9. **Key Relationships** - Important people and their roles
10. **Critical Decision** - The choice that set everything in motion
11. **Accelerating Danger** - Events spiraling toward the opening scene

## RETURN TO PRESENT ACTION (40% of the story)
**Purpose:** Continue and escalate from the opening scene

12. **Resume Opening Scene** - Pick up where we left off
13. **Immediate Resolution** - Escape or survive the opening crisis
14. **Larger Threat Revealed** - The real scope of danger
15. **New Obstacles** - Fresh challenges based on what we now know
16. **Allies and Resources** - Who/what helps the protagonist
17. **Rising Action** - Multiple escalating confrontations
18. **Devastating Setback** - All seems lost
19. **Final Gambit** - The last desperate plan

## CLIMAX AND RESOLUTION (20% of the story)
**Purpose:** Payoff all setup with satisfying conclusion

20. **Ultimate Confrontation** - Face the core threat/antagonist
21. **Use of Knowledge** - Apply lessons from flashback
22. **Moment of Truth** - Character's ultimate test
23. **Resolution** - How the central conflict ends
24. **New Normal** - The changed world/character
25. **Final Reflection** - Understanding the full journey

CRITICAL: The in medias res structure requires:
- An opening scene so compelling readers must know what happens
- Flashbacks that enhance rather than slow the story
- Clear time transitions to avoid confusion
- Payoff that justifies the non-linear approach
