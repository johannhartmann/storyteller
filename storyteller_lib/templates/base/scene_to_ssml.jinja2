You are an expert SSML specialist and audiobook director. Your task is to convert a literary text into a richly annotated SSML document. The goal is to create an immersive and atmospheric audio experience that perfectly captures the mood of the text.

Instructions:
Analyze the following text and apply SSML tags precisely to control the drama, mood, and rhythm. Adhere to these rules:

Basic Structure: 
- Wrap the entire text in a <speak> tag with proper attributes
- Use a primary <voice> tag for the narrator's voice (e.g., <voice name="en-US-JennyNeural">)
- Use <p> tags for paragraphs and <s> tags for sentences to improve natural flow

Pauses and Pacing (<break>):
- Insert a clear pause (<break time="1200ms"/>) between all paragraphs to give the listener a moment to process
- Add short pauses (<break time="300ms"/> to <break time="500ms"/>) in places where a change of thought occurs or to build tension
- Use longer, dramatic pauses (<break time="1500ms"/> or more) after major revelations or before a meaningful final sentence
- Alternative: use strength attribute (<break strength="medium"/> or "strong")

Emphasis (<emphasis>):
- Identify keywords that are crucial to the plot, mood, or central theme (e.g., names, locations, clues, emotional states)
- Use <emphasis level="moderate"> for important descriptive adjectives or verbs that build atmosphere
- Use <emphasis level="strong"> for the most critical clues and revelations

Prosody (<prosody>):
IMPORTANT - Correct syntax for rate:
- For SLOWER speech: use rate="-20%" (20% slower) or rate="slow" 
- For FASTER speech: use rate="+20%" (20% faster) or rate="fast"
- NEVER use rate="90%" (this means 90% faster, almost double speed!)
- Valid constants: x-slow, slow, medium (default), fast, x-fast

Examples:
- Atmospheric descriptions: <prosody rate="slow"> or <prosody rate="-15%">
- Action scenes: <prosody rate="+10%"> or <prosody rate="fast">
- Character dialogue: vary pitch with pitch="-10%" for deep voices, pitch="+10%" for higher voices
- Quoted text/notes: <prosody pitch="-5%" rate="-10%"> to differentiate from narration

Additional Elements:
- Use <say-as> for dates, times, numbers: <say-as interpret-as="date">10/14/2024</say-as>
- Use <sub> for pronunciation: <sub alias="Doctor Watson">Dr. Watson</sub>
- Use <lang> for foreign words: <lang xml:lang="fr-FR">bonjour</lang>

Character Dialogue: For character dialogue, consider using different voices or prosody adjustments to distinguish speakers, especially in conversations.

Genre and Tone Considerations:
- Genre: {{ genre }}
- Tone: {{ tone }}
Adjust your SSML markup to reflect these elements. For example, a thriller might have more dramatic pauses and emphasis, while a comedy might have faster pacing and lighter emphasis.

Scene Context:
Chapter {{ chapter_number }}, Scene {{ scene_number }}
{{ scene_description }}

{% if is_first_scene_in_book %}
IMPORTANT: This is the very first scene of the book. Begin with:
1. An announcement of the book title "{{ book_title }}" with strong emphasis
2. A dramatic pause (2000ms)
3. The chapter announcement "Chapter {{ chapter_number }}: {{ chapter_title }}" with moderate emphasis
4. Another pause (1500ms)
5. Then begin the scene content

Example structure:
<p>
  <emphasis level="strong">{{ book_title }}</emphasis>
  <break time="2000ms"/>
  <emphasis level="moderate">Chapter {{ chapter_number }}: {{ chapter_title }}</emphasis>
  <break time="1500ms"/>
</p>
{% elif is_first_scene_in_chapter %}
IMPORTANT: This is the first scene of a new chapter. Begin with:
1. The chapter announcement "Chapter {{ chapter_number }}: {{ chapter_title }}" with moderate emphasis
2. A pause (1500ms)
3. Then begin the scene content

Example structure:
<p>
  <emphasis level="moderate">Chapter {{ chapter_number }}: {{ chapter_title }}</emphasis>
  <break time="1500ms"/>
</p>
{% endif %}

Your Task:
Now, apply these principles to the text provided below. Create a complete, ready-to-use SSML document that will enhance the audiobook experience.

Text to convert:
{{ scene_content }}

IMPORTANT: 
1. Return ONLY the SSML-formatted content, starting with <speak> and ending with </speak>.
2. The <speak> tag MUST include: version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US"
3. Do not include any explanations or comments.
