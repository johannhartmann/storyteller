{# Base template for scene structure pattern analysis - English version #}
Analyze these scenes from a {{ genre }} story with {{ tone }} tone for repetitive structural patterns.

SCENES TO ANALYZE:
{{ scenes }}

Look for patterns such as:
1. Character dynamics that repeat (e.g., "character avoids → authority appears → character accepts")
2. Scene progressions that follow the same beats
3. Conflict resolution patterns that recur
4. Emotional arcs that repeat across scenes

For each pattern found:
- Identify what makes it repetitive
- Note which scenes use this pattern
- Consider if the repetition serves a purpose or feels unintentional
- Suggest variations that would maintain story coherence

Remember:
- Some repetition can be intentional (rule of three, building tension)
- {{ genre }} stories may have expected patterns that shouldn't be varied
- Focus on patterns that might bore or frustrate readers
- Small variations can make big differences

Assess the overall structural variety and provide specific recommendations.
