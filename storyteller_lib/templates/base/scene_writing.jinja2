CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION GUIDELINES:
1. DO NOT repeat any events, descriptions, or dialogue from the previous chapters summary above
2. DO NOT reuse character introductions - assume readers know established characters
3. FORBIDDEN PHRASES that have been overused: {{ forbidden_phrases | join(', ') }}
4. DO NOT use these scene structures again: {{ forbidden_structures | join(', ') }}
5. Each scene must show NEW developments, NOT variations of previous events
6. Character knowledge state: Characters should act based on what they've learned in previous scenes
7. Vary your sentence structures - avoid starting multiple paragraphs the same way
8. DO NOT repeat these specific elements: visions of other worlds, system anomalies, dismissing symptoms as stress
9. This scene MUST be {{ scene_type }} focused, NOT another maintenance/vision scene

WRITING GUIDELINES:
1. Start the scene immediately with action, dialogue, or vivid description
2. Show character emotions through actions and dialogue, not exposition
3. Use all five senses to create immersive descriptions
4. Advance the plot while developing characters
5. End with a hook that propels the reader forward
6. Maintain consistent POV throughout the scene
7. Write 800-1200 words
8. Ensure this scene is UNIQUE and hasn't been written before
