{# Base template for intelligent repetition analysis - English version #}
Analyze the following text for repetition, considering the story's genre ({{ genre }}), tone ({{ tone }}), and author style ({{ author_style }}).

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
{{ text }}

{% if story_context %}
STORY CONTEXT:
{{ story_context }}
{% endif %}

Your task is to distinguish between:
1. INTENTIONAL REPETITION that serves a narrative purpose (emphasis, rhythm, comedy callbacks, thematic reinforcement, character voice)
2. UNINTENTIONAL REPETITION that feels accidental or detracts from the reading experience

For each repeated element you identify, evaluate:
- Is this repetition appropriate for a {{ genre }} story with {{ tone }} tone?
- Does it match the author's style?
- Does it enhance or detract from the narrative?
- Would varying it improve the text, or should it be preserved?

Consider that:
- Comedy often uses repetition for callbacks and running gags
- Literary fiction may use repetition for rhythm or emphasis
- Children's stories often repeat for memorability
- Thrillers might repeat for urgency
- Poetry and lyrical prose use repetition as a device

Provide:
1. A list of intentional repetitions with their narrative purpose
2. A list of unintentional repetitions that should be varied
3. An overall assessment of whether the repetition level suits the genre/tone
4. Specific, actionable suggestions that respect the story's style
