{# Base template for scene transitions - English version #}
Create a smooth transition between these two scenes:

ENDING OF PREVIOUS SCENE:
{{ previous_scene_ending }}

BEGINNING OF NEXT SCENE:
{{ next_scene_beginning }}

CONTEXT:
- Previous: Chapter {{ previous_chapter }}, Scene {{ previous_scene }}
- Next: Chapter {{ next_chapter }}, Scene {{ next_scene }}
- Genre: {{ genre }}
- Tone: {{ tone }}

{% if time_gap %}
TIME GAP: {{ time_gap }}
{% endif %}

{% if location_change %}
LOCATION CHANGE: From {{ previous_location }} to {{ next_location }}
{% endif %}

{% if pov_change %}
POINT OF VIEW CHANGE: From {{ previous_pov }} to {{ next_pov }}
{% endif %}

{% if emotional_shift %}
EMOTIONAL SHIFT: {{ emotional_shift }}
{% endif %}

TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Bridge the gap between scenes naturally
2. Maintain narrative momentum
3. Orient the reader to any changes (time, place, POV)
4. Preserve emotional continuity or explain shifts
5. Set up the new scene's tone and focus
6. Keep the transition concise (1-3 paragraphs)

TRANSITION TYPES TO CONSIDER:
- Direct continuation (immediate follow-up)
- Time skip (hours, days, weeks later)
- Location shift (moving to new setting)
- Character switch (changing POV)
- Emotional bridge (mood transition)
- Thematic link (connecting ideas)
- Cliffhanger resolution (answering previous tension)

{% if plot_threads %}
ACTIVE PLOT THREADS TO MAINTAIN:
{% for thread in plot_threads %}
- {{ thread.name }}: {{ thread.status }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if specific_requirements %}
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
{{ specific_requirements }}
{% endif %}

Write a transition that:
- Connects the scenes seamlessly
- Provides necessary orientation
- Maintains reader engagement
- Sets up the new scene effectively

Provide ONLY the transition text (1-3 paragraphs), nothing else.
