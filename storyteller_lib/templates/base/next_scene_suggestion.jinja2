{# Base template for next scene suggestion - English version #}
Based on the story context, suggest the most appropriate type and focus for the next scene in this {{ genre }} story with {{ tone }} tone.

RECENT SCENE TYPES:
{% for scene_type in recent_scene_types %}
- {{ scene_type }}
{% endfor %}

CHAPTER OUTLINE:
{{ chapter_outline }}

REMAINING CHAPTER GOALS:
{% for goal in remaining_goals %}
- {{ goal }}
{% endfor %}

Consider:
1. What scene type would best serve the story at this point?
2. Should we vary from recent patterns or continue them?
3. What would maintain appropriate pacing for {{ genre }}?
4. What would preserve the {{ tone }} tone?
5. What elements should be included or avoided?

Provide a suggestion that serves the story's needs rather than following rigid variety rules. Sometimes repetition is the right choice; sometimes variety is essential.
