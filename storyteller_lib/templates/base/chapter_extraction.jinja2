{# Base template for chapter extraction - English version #}
Based on the chapter plan you've created, I need you to extract a list of chapters with their key scenes.

For each chapter, provide:
1. The chapter number (as a string)
2. A title
3. A detailed outline (200-300 words)
4. 3-5 key scenes that should be included in this chapter (with a brief description for each)

For the key scenes, focus on the most important moments that advance the plot or develop characters.

Format your response as a list of chapters, each with these properties.

Chapter plan:
{{ chapter_plan_text }}
