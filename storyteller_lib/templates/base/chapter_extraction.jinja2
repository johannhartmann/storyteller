{# Base template for chapter extraction - English version #}
Based on the chapter plan you've created, I need you to extract a list of chapters with their key scenes.

For each chapter, provide:
1. The chapter number (as a string)
2. A title
3. A detailed outline (200-300 words)
4. For each of the 3-5 key scenes, provide:
   - Description: Brief description of what happens
   - Plot progressions: List of specific plot points revealed/advanced
   - Character learns: List of "CharacterName: what they learn"
   - Required characters: List of characters who must appear
   - Forbidden repetitions: List of plot points that must NOT be repeated

Extract all the scene details from the chapter plan, including the specific plot progression keys.

Format your response as a list of chapters, each with these properties.
