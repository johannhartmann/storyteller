Extract comprehensive findings about religion, focusing on:
1. **Belief Systems**: Detailed examples of religious philosophies, pantheons, creation myths, and spiritual worldviews
2. **Religious Practices**: Specific rituals, ceremonies, prayer methods, and devotional activities
3. **Sacred Elements**: Actual religious texts, historical prophecies, pilgrimage sites, and holy artifacts

5. **Faith and Power**: How religions have influenced governments, laws, and social structures
6. **Religious Dynamics**: Historical religious conflicts, reformations, syncretism, and interfaith relations

Provide your findings in the following format:
- insight_keys: A pipe-separated list of descriptive category names (e.g., "buddhist_monastery_structure|medieval_pilgrimage_practices|religious_syncretism_examples|prophecy_traditions")
- insight_values: A pipe-separated list of DETAILED, PARAGRAPH-LENGTH descriptions with specific examples, historical context, and rich details that can inspire worldbuilding

Example of the level of detail needed:
- Key: "medieval_monastery_life"
- Value: "Medieval Benedictine monasteries followed the Rule of St. Benedict, organizing daily life around eight prayer services called the Divine Office. Monks rose at 2 AM for Matins, the longest service lasting 1-2 hours. The monastery operated as a self-sufficient community with its own farms, workshops, scriptoriums for copying texts, and infirmaries. Abbots wielded significant political power, controlling vast lands and serving as advisors to kings. Monasteries preserved classical knowledge through their libraries and scriptoriums, with monks spending hours each day copying manuscripts by hand. The vow of stability meant monks remained at one monastery for life, creating deep institutional memory and continuity."
