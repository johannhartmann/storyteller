{# Base template for validating brainstormed ideas - English version #}
Evaluate whether these brainstormed ideas properly incorporate the initial story idea:

Initial Idea: "{{ initial_idea }}"

Story Concepts:
{{ story_concepts }}

World Building Elements:
{{ world_building }}

Central Conflicts:
{{ central_conflicts }}

For each category, provide:
1. A score from 1-10 on how well it adheres to the initial idea
2. Specific feedback on what elements are missing or need adjustment
3. A YES/NO determination if the ideas are acceptable

If any category scores below 7 or receives a NO, provide specific guidance on how to improve it.

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Do the story concepts maintain the core premise of the initial idea?
- Are the world building elements consistent with the setting described?
- Do the conflicts arise naturally from the initial setup?
- Are key characters and their roles preserved?
- Is the essence of the story maintained?

Be thorough but constructive in your feedback.
