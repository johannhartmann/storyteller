CONSISTENCY CHECKS REQUIRED:

1. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
   - Do characters behave according to their established traits?
   - Are character knowledge and abilities consistent?
   - Do character relationships match previous interactions?

3. PLOT CONSISTENCY:

   - Do plot developments align with established threads?

4. TIMELINE CONSISTENCY:
   - Does the timing of events make sense?
   - Are travel times and durations realistic?
   - Do references to past events match the timeline?

5. DETAIL CONSISTENCY:
   - Are physical descriptions consistent?
   - Do item locations and states match?
   - Are names and titles used correctly?
