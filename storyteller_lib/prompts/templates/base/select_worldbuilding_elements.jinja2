Select portions from the worldbuilding above that are relevant and useful for this specific scene.

EXAMPLE SELECTION:
{
  "content": "The narrow, winding alleys crisscross the old town like a living labyrinth, hiding secrets and intrigues as well as small craft shops and inns. At the center stands the imposing St. John's Church, home to the notorious choir."
}

Prioritize elements that:
- Match the scene's location ({{ location }}) - especially geography/location content
- Directly support the scene's action or dialogue
- Provide necessary context for character motivations
- Enhance the atmosphere without overwhelming
- Add authentic detail that serves the story

Avoid elements that:
- Are tangentially related but not actually useful
- Would distract from the scene's focus
- Have already been extensively covered
