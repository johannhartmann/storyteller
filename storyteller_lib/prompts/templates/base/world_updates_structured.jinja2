{# Base template for structuring world updates - English version #}
Based on these potential world updates:

{{ world_updates_text }}

And these existing world elements:

{{ world_elements }}

For each category of world elements that needs updates, provide:
1. Category name (geography, history, culture, politics, economics, technology_magic, religion, daily_life)
2. Specific elements within that category to add or update

Format as a JSON object where keys are category names and values are objects with the elements to update.
Only include categories and elements that have meaningful updates from this scene.

GUIDELINES:
- Only include categories with actual updates
- Be specific about what's being added or modified
- Ensure updates are consistent with existing elements
- Avoid redundant information already present
- Focus on significant world-building additions
