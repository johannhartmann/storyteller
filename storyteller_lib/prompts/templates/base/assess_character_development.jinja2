{# Base template for assessing character development - English version #}
Assess whether {{ character_name }}'s development is appropriate for a {{ genre }} story with {{ tone }} tone at {{ story_progress_percentage }}% completion.

CHARACTER HISTORY:
{{ character_history }}

PROMISES MADE ABOUT THIS CHARACTER:
{% for promise in promises %}
- {{ promise.promise_type }}: {{ promise.promise_description }} (introduced chapter {{ promise.introduced_chapter }})
{% endfor %}

STORY PROGRESS: Chapter {{ current_chapter }} of {{ total_chapters }}

Evaluate:
1. Is the character's development pace appropriate for where we are in the story?
2. Are promises being addressed at suitable times?
3. Does the development align with {{ genre }} genre expectations?
4. Is the character changing too fast, too slow, or just right?

Consider:
- In {{ genre }}, reader expectations for character change
- The {{ tone }} tone's impact on development pace
- Whether static periods serve a purpose (building tension, showing resistance)
- Whether changes feel earned based on experiences

For each promise, assess:
- Has it been fulfilled?
- If not, is the timing still appropriate?
- Are we seeing progress toward fulfillment?

Provide specific, actionable recommendations that respect the story's style.
