{{ language_instruction }}

Create a compelling story outline for a {{ tone }} {{ genre }} narrative following the kishōtenketsu (起承転結) structure.
{% if initial_idea %}This story should be based on this initial idea: '{{ initial_idea }}'{% endif %}

Structure your outline according to the four-act kishōtenketsu format:

## KI (起) - INTRODUCTION (25% of the story)
**Purpose:** Introduce characters, setting, and situation without conflict

1. **Opening Scene** - Establish the everyday world and atmosphere
2. **Character Introduction** - Present protagonists in their natural state
3. **World Details** - Rich sensory details of the setting
4. **Daily Rhythms** - The patterns and routines of life
5. **Relationships** - How characters relate to each other and their world
6. **Subtle Tensions** - Hints of unease or questions, not conflicts

## SHŌ (承) - DEVELOPMENT (25% of the story)
**Purpose:** Deepen understanding and develop the situation

7. **Expanding View** - Broaden the scope of the world/situation
8. **Character Depth** - Reveal more about motivations and desires
9. **Parallel Elements** - Introduce seemingly unrelated threads
10. **Building Atmosphere** - Intensify mood without direct conflict
11. **Questions Arise** - Natural curiosity about where things lead
12. **Connections Form** - Subtle links between elements

## TEN (転) - TWIST/TURN (25% of the story)
**Purpose:** Introduce unexpected perspective that recontextualizes everything

13. **The Revelation** - A discovery, arrival, or event that changes perspective
14. **New Understanding** - How this twist reframes earlier events
15. **Shifted Dynamics** - Relationships and situations seen differently
16. **Emotional Impact** - Characters process this new reality
17. **Ripple Effects** - How the twist affects all story elements
18. **Integration** - Characters adapt to new understanding

## KETSU (結) - CONCLUSION (25% of the story)
**Purpose:** Bring all elements together in harmonious resolution

19. **Synthesis** - All threads weave together naturally
20. **New Equilibrium** - A changed but stable state
21. **Reflection** - Characters' understanding of their journey
22. **Circular Elements** - Echoes of the beginning, transformed
23. **Lingering Questions** - What remains beautifully unresolved
24. **Final Image** - A moment that captures the story's essence

For each section, provide specific details that:
- Build naturally from the initial idea without forcing conflict
- Develop characters through observation and insight
- Use the setting as an active story element
- Create engagement through curiosity rather than tension

Important: The "twist" (ten) is NOT a conflict or problem, but a new perspective that makes us see everything differently - like discovering a friend is actually a long-lost sibling, or realizing the abandoned garden was once a shrine.

Also include:
- Title: [A poetic title that captures the story's essence]
- Main Characters: 3-4 characters with inner lives and connections
- Central Question: What the story explores (not a conflict)
- Setting: A rich, atmospheric location integral to the story
- Themes: Philosophical or emotional ideas examined
- Mood: How the {{ tone }} quality creates atmosphere
