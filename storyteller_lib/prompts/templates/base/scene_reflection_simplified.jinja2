Evaluate these 4 critical aspects:

1. **Overall Quality** (1-10): Is this a well-written, engaging scene?
2. **Plot Advancement**: Does the scene meaningfully advance the story?
3. **Character Consistency**: Do characters act according to their established traits?
4. **Engaging Prose**: Is the writing clear, vivid, and appropriate for the genre/tone?

Identify any CRITICAL issues that would require revision:
- Plot requirements not met

- Wrong tone or genre feel
- Language consistency issues (should be in {{ language }})

Only recommend revision if there are critical issues or overall quality < 6.
