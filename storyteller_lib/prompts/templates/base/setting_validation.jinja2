{# Base template for setting validation - English version #}
Evaluate whether this story outline properly incorporates the required setting: "{{ setting }}"

Story Outline:
{{ story_outline }}

Check:
1. Is the specified setting clearly established as the primary location?
2. Are there any unauthorized setting changes or substitutions?
3. Is the setting used meaningfully throughout the story?
4. Does the setting influence plot events and character actions?
5. Are setting details consistent with the initial specification?

Provide:
- A score from 1-10 for setting incorporation
- Specific examples of where the setting is used well
- Any instances where the setting was ignored or changed
- Recommendations for better setting integration if needed

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The setting MUST match the initial specification exactly
- No substitutions (e.g., "any coastal village" instead of the specific one mentioned)
- The setting should be integral to the plot, not just backdrop
- Cultural and geographical accuracy for the specified location
- Setting-specific challenges or opportunities should be utilized

EVALUATION FOCUS:
- Opening establishes the setting clearly
- Setting affects character decisions
- Environmental elements drive plot points
- Atmosphere reflects the location
- No contradictions with setting constraints
