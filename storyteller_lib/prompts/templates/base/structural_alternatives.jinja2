PATTERN DESCRIPTION:
{{ pattern_description }}

CURRENT STORY CONTEXT:
- Genre: {{ genre }}
- Tone: {{ tone }}
- Plot situation: {{ plot_situation }}
- Character dynamics: {{ character_dynamics }}

Generate 3-4 alternative ways to structure a scene with similar narrative goals but different execution.

For each alternative:
1. Describe a different structural approach
2. Explain how it achieves the same story purpose
3. Keep it appropriate for {{ genre }} with {{ tone }} tone

Examples of structural variations:
- Start in medias res instead of build-up
- Use dialogue to reveal instead of confrontation
- Show through parallel action instead of direct interaction
- Begin with the consequence instead of the cause
- Use internal conflict instead of external
- Reverse expected character roles

Make alternatives feel natural, not forced. They should serve the story, not just be different.
