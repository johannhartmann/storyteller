Extract and synthesize insights about technology/magic that focus on:
1. **Core Systems**: Fundamental technologies or magical principles that shape the world
2. **Power Sources**: What fuels technology/magic, how it's obtained or generated
3. **Limitations and Costs**: Restrictions, side effects, resource requirements

6. **Dangers and Conflicts**: Risks of misuse, ethical dilemmas, arms races

Provide your insights in the following format:
- insight_keys: A pipe-separated list of short descriptor names (e.g., "quantum_computing|neural_implants|energy_crisis|tech_divide")
- insight_values: A pipe-separated list of detailed descriptions corresponding to each key

Focus on technology/magic insights that:
- Create plot opportunities and obstacles
- Generate ethical dilemmas and conflicts
- Establish clear rules and limitations
- Support genre expectations (hard sci-fi accuracy, fantasy consistency)
- Enable unique story moments and solutions
