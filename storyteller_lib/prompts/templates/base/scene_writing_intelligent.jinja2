## YOUR TASK

Following both the book-level style guide and the scene-specific requirements above, write this scene now. The scene should:

1. Be 800-1200 words (but prioritize pacing over word count - shorter is better than bloated)
2. Start immediately in action or dialogue - no scene-setting preambles
3. Remain fully in scene without summaries or time skips
4. Build tension naturally to the specified level
5. End in a way that propels the story forward
6. Feel consistent with the established style and tone

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Maximum 1-2 metaphors in the entire scene
- Maintain single POV throughout - establish POV character in first paragraph
- Every description must advance plot or reveal character
- Aim for 70% action/dialogue, 30% description
- Cut ruthlessly - if a sentence doesn't earn its place, don't write it

Write ONLY the scene content itself - no meta comments, analysis, or explanatory notes about the scene.
