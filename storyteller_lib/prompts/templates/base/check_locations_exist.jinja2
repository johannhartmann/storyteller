{# Template for checking if locations exist in worldbuilding #}
You need to check if the following locations from the story scenes already exist in the worldbuilding.

LOCATIONS TO CHECK:
{% for location in locations %}
- {{ location }}
{% endfor %}

EXISTING WORLDBUILDING CONTENT:
{{ existing_worldbuilding }}

For each location, determine:
1. Whether it semantically exists in the worldbuilding (not just keyword matching - understand if "The old church" refers to "St. Johannis Church" for example)
2. If it exists, what is the key of the existing entry
3. Whether a new location entry should be created
4. If new, suggest a brief description based on the location name

IMPORTANT: Use semantic understanding, not keyword matching. Consider:
- A room inside a building exists if the building is in worldbuilding
- Different names might refer to the same place
- Additional descriptive details don't make it a different location
- Time qualifiers (dawn, night, winter) don't create new locations

CRITICAL: Before marking a location as new, check if it's just a variation of an existing location:
- More detailed versions (adding "above the shop" to a room name)
- Abbreviated versions (dropping descriptive details)
- Different terms for the same type of place (room/chamber/quarters)
- Same location at different times or conditions

Group all variations of the same physical location together.

Provide your analysis for each location.
