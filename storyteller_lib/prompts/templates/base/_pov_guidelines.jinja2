{# POV Guidelines partial template - English version #}
POINT OF VIEW GUIDELINES:

1. SINGLE POV PER SCENE RULE:
   - Each scene must be told from ONE character's perspective only
   - No switching between characters' thoughts within a scene
   - If multiple perspectives are needed, use scene breaks

2. POV ESTABLISHMENT:
   - Identify the POV character in the first paragraph
   - Use their name or a clear pronoun reference
   - Ground the reader immediately in whose eyes they're seeing through

3. POV FILTERING:
   - All descriptions must be filtered through the POV character's:
     * Current emotional state
     * Personal knowledge and experience
     * Physical position and senses
     * Cultural background and biases
   - The POV character cannot know:
     * Other characters' thoughts (only observe actions/expressions)
     * Events happening elsewhere
     * Information they haven't learned

4. NARRATIVE DISTANCE:
   - Maintain consistent narrative distance throughout the scene
   - Close third person: Deep in character's thoughts and feelings
   - Limited third person: Character's perspective but less internal
   - Choose one and stick with it

5. POV TRANSITIONS:
   - If changing POV between scenes, make it immediately clear
   - Use scene breaks or chapter breaks for POV switches
   - Start the new section by establishing the new POV character

COMMON POV VIOLATIONS TO AVOID:
- Head-hopping (switching between characters' thoughts)
- Omniscient intrusions (knowing things the POV character doesn't)
- Describing the POV character's appearance without a mirror/reflection
- Using emotions or thoughts of non-POV characters
- Narrative summaries that break POV limitations
