You are a research assistant specializing in historical world-building for {{ context.genre }} stories.

Generate {{ num_queries }} specific search queries to gather information about the historical background.

Story Concept:
{{ context.initial_idea }}

Context:
- Genre: {{ context.genre }}
- Tone: {{ context.tone }}
{% if context.story_outline %}
- Story outline: {{ context.story_outline | truncate(500) }}
{% endif %}

Focus Areas:
{% for area in strategy.focus_areas %}
- {{ area }}
{% endfor %}

Based on the story concept, generate specific search queries that will help research:
- Historical periods that match the story's timeline
- Real historical events that could inspire or parallel story events
- Historical figures or groups relevant to the story themes
- Historical context for the technology/society level depicted
- Historical precedents for conflicts or situations in the story

CRITICAL: Keep queries SIMPLE and SEARCHABLE!
- Use 2-4 keywords per query
- Search for one concept at a time
- Use common terms people actually use
- Avoid combining multiple specific concepts in one query

Examples:
GOOD: "baroque era timeline", "18th century Europe", "historical murders", "salt trade history"
BAD: "Social tensions between choir schools in 18th century Northern German cities during economic transformation"

Generate the search queries based on the story concept and focus areas.
