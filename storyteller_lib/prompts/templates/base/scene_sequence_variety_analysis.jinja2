{# Base template for scene sequence variety analysis - English version #}
Analyze this sequence of scenes from a {{ genre }} story with {{ tone }} tone to determine if the variety level is appropriate.

STORY CONTEXT:
{{ story_context }}

RECENT SCENE SEQUENCE:
{{ scene_sequence }}

Evaluate:
1. Is there a pattern in the scene types/focuses?
2. If there's a pattern, does it serve the {{ genre }} genre or {{ tone }} tone?
3. Is the variety level appropriate for this type of story?
4. Are there story reasons (like building tension, time loops, parallel structure) that justify any repetition?

Consider genre expectations:
- Action/Adventure: High variety, quick pacing
- Mystery: Methodical investigation scenes may repeat
- Romance: Emotional scenes may have similar structures
- Literary: May intentionally use repetitive structures for effect
- Comedy: Setup/payoff patterns are common
- Horror: Building dread through similar scenes is valid

Determine if any detected patterns are problematic or purposeful.
