Generate {{ num_queries }} specific search queries to gather information about religious and spiritual systems.

Story Concept:
{{ context.initial_idea }}

Context:
- Genre: {{ context.genre }}
- Tone: {{ context.tone }}
- Setting: {{ context.setting }}
{% if context.story_outline %}
- Story Outline: {{ context.story_outline }}
{% endif %}

Focus Areas:
{% for area in strategy.focus_areas %}
- {{ area }}
{% endfor %}

Based on the story concept, generate queries that explore:
- Religious beliefs and spiritual practices relevant to the setting
- Sacred texts, prophets, or divine figures that influence characters
- Religious conflicts or harmony that affect the plot
- Rituals, ceremonies, and observances that shape daily life
- Moral and ethical systems derived from religious beliefs

Generate diverse, specific queries that will help build authentic religious beliefs and spiritual practices.

CRITICAL: Keep queries SIMPLE and SEARCHABLE!
- Use 2-4 keywords per query
- Search for one concept at a time
- Use common terms people actually use
- Avoid combining multiple specific concepts in one query

Examples:
GOOD: "Lutheran church history", "baroque church music", "18th century clergy", "Protestant traditions"
BAD: "Religious tensions and musical expression in post-Reformation Protestant churches of Northern Germany"

Generate the search queries based on the story concept and focus areas.
