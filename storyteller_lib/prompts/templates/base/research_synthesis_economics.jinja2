Extract and synthesize insights about economics that focus on:
1. **Resources and Scarcity**: Key resources, their distribution, what's abundant vs. rare
2. **Trade and Commerce**: Trade routes, merchant classes, markets, economic centers
3. **Currency and Finance**: Monetary systems, banking, debt, economic instruments
4. **Economic Classes**: Wealth distribution, social mobility, poverty vs. affluence
5. **Labor and Production**: Who works, how goods are made, guilds, unions
6. **Economic Conflicts**: Resource wars, trade disputes, economic inequality tensions

Provide your insights in the following format:
- insight_keys: A pipe-separated list of short descriptor names (e.g., "water_scarcity|merchant_monopoly|debt_slavery|guild_power")
- insight_values: A pipe-separated list of detailed descriptions corresponding to each key

Focus on economic insights that:
- Drive character motivations (survival, ambition, desperation)
- Create societal tensions and conflicts
- Explain power dynamics in your world
- Provide plot opportunities (heists, trade negotiations, economic collapse)
- Reflect genre appropriately (cyberpunk megacorps, fantasy guilds, etc.)
