EXPOSITION DETECTION CRITERIA:

1. INFO-DUMPING (Score 1-10):
   - Characters explaining things they already know
   - Unnatural dialogue that exists only to inform reader
   - Long monologues of backstory or world information
   - "As you know" syndrome

2. FORCED EXPOSITION (Score 1-10):
   - Information shoehorned into conversations
   - Characters thinking about things unnaturally
   - Narrator intrusions with excessive detail
   - Timing that feels contrived

3. TELLING VS SHOWING (Score 1-10):
   - Direct statements instead of demonstrations
   - Emotions told rather than shown
   - Character traits explained rather than revealed
   - World details listed rather than experienced

4. PACING IMPACT (Score 1-10):
   - Exposition that stops story momentum
   - Information overload in single scenes
   - Backstory interrupting action
   - Details that slow reader engagement

TYPES OF EXPOSITION TO IDENTIFY:
- Backstory dumps
- World-building lectures
- Character history monologues
- Technical/magical system explanations
- Historical context intrusions
- Relationship explanations
- Motivational speeches that over-explain

For each instance of problematic exposition:
1. Quote the specific passage
2. Identify the type of exposition
3. Explain why it's problematic
4. Rate severity (1-10)
5. Suggest how to integrate it more naturally

GOOD EXPOSITION EXAMPLES:
- Information revealed through action
- Details emerging from character interactions
- World-building through sensory experience
- Backstory revealed through behavior
- Conflict that naturally exposes information

Identify ALL instances of heavy-handed exposition and provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement.
