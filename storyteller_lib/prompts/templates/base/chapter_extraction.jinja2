{# Base template for chapter extraction - English version #}
Based on the chapter plan you've created, I need you to extract a list of chapters with their key scenes.

IMPORTANT: Extract CHAPTERS, not acts or sections. If the plan uses a structure like "3-act" with acts containing chapters, extract each individual CHAPTER within those acts.

For each chapter, provide:
1. The chapter number (as a string, e.g., "1", "2", "3", etc.)
2. A title (the chapter's title, NOT the act title)
3. A detailed outline (200-300 words)
4. For each of the 3-5 key scenes, provide:
   - Description: The detailed 3-5 sentence summary of what happens in this scene
   - Location: The primary location where the scene takes place
   - Plot progressions: List of specific plot points revealed/advanced
   - Character learns: List of "CharacterName: what they learn"
   - Required characters: List of characters who must appear
   - Forbidden repetitions: List of plot points that must NOT be repeated

Extract all the scene details from the chapter plan, including the specific plot progression keys.

Format your response as a list of chapters, each with these properties.

Chapter plan:
{{ chapter_plan_text }}

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- Extract individual CHAPTERS, not acts or structural divisions
- If the plan has acts/sections containing chapters, extract the chapters within them
- Number chapters sequentially across the entire story (1, 2, 3... not resetting per act)
- Include all chapters mentioned in the plan, regardless of which act they belong to
- Preserve chapter numbers as strings ("1", "2", etc.)
- Keep scene descriptions concise but clear
- Focus on plot-critical and character-defining moments

SCENE SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Advances the main plot
- Reveals character development
- Contains important dialogue or action
- Sets up future events
- Resolves previous tensions

Ensure each scene description includes:
- What happens
- Who is involved
- Why it matters to the story
