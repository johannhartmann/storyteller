Extract and synthesize insights about geography that focus on:
1. **Terrain and Landscapes**: Mountain ranges, valleys, rivers, coastlines, unique geological features
2. **Climate and Weather**: Weather patterns, seasonal variations, extreme conditions, microclimates
3. **Natural Resources**: Minerals, water sources, fertile lands, forests, strategic resources
4. **Strategic Locations**: Natural harbors, mountain passes, river crossings, defensible positions
5. **Environmental Challenges**: Natural disasters, harsh regions, environmental barriers
6. **Unique Geographic Features**: Anything unusual or distinctive that could shape the story

Provide your insights in the following format:
- insight_keys: A pipe-separated list of short descriptor names (e.g., "mountain_barrier|coastal_trade_routes|volcanic_activity|resource_scarcity")
- insight_values: A pipe-separated list of detailed descriptions corresponding to each key

Focus on geographic insights that:
- Create natural boundaries and regions for your world
- Influence where civilizations develop
- Present challenges or opportunities for characters
- Support the story's plot and conflicts
- Match the genre expectations (e.g., mysterious islands for adventure, harsh wastelands for post-apocalyptic)
