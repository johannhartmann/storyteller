IDENTIFY SPECIFIC ISSUES:

For each pacing problem found:
1. Quote the problematic text
2. Identify the issue type (dialogue, description, action, reflection)
3. Explain why it slows the narrative
4. Suggest a more concise revision
5. Note where in the scene it occurs (beginning, middle, end)

LOOK FOR:
- Redundant information
- Overlong dialogue exchanges
- Excessive description (more than 30% of scene)
- Unnecessary exposition
- Repetitive actions or thoughts
- Loss of tension points
- Meandering passages
- Scene openings that don't start in media res
- Purple prose or overwrought metaphors
- Description that doesn't serve plot or character
- Passive voice slowing momentum
- Internal monologues that halt action
- Scenic throat-clearing before the real action
- Gratuitous world-building insertions

GENRE CONSIDERATIONS:
- {{ genre }} typically requires {{ 'fast-paced action' if genre == 'thriller' else 'varied pacing with tension peaks' if genre == 'mystery' else 'balanced pacing with room for world-building' if genre == 'fantasy' else 'character-focused pacing' if genre == 'literary' else 'dynamic pacing' }}
- {{ tone }} tone suggests {{ 'quick, energetic pace' if tone == 'adventurous' else 'deliberate, measured pace' if tone == 'contemplative' else 'tension-building pace' if tone == 'suspenseful' else 'varied, emotionally-driven pace' }}

Determine if the pacing is appropriate for the genre and tone.
