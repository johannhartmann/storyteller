{# Template for synthesizing book-level writing instructions #}
You are tasked with creating comprehensive writing instructions for a {{ tone }} {{ genre }} story{% if author %} in the style of {{ author }}{% endif %}.

{% if initial_idea %}
The story is based on this initial idea: {{ initial_idea }}
{% endif %}

{% if author and author_style_guidance %}
AUTHOR STYLE ANALYSIS:
{{ author_style_guidance }}
{% endif %}

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- WORD VARIETY: Avoid word repetition within paragraphs. Each descriptive word (especially nouns, adjectives, verbs) should appear only once per paragraph.
- VOCABULARY RICHNESS: Use synonyms and varied expressions rather than repeating the same words.
- SENTENCE VARIATION: Mix sentence lengths and structures to create rhythm.
- FRESH DESCRIPTIONS: Each mention of an object, character, or location should add new information or perspective.
- NO REDUNDANCY: Never use multiple words that mean the same thing together (e.g., "dark black", "wet rain", "faded pale").

PACING AND CLARITY REQUIREMENTS:
- METAPHOR RESTRAINT: Use metaphors sparingly (maximum 1-2 per scene). Reserve them for key emotional or thematic moments.
- CONCRETE IMAGERY: Prefer direct, sensory descriptions over abstract comparisons. Ground the reader in physical reality.
- BRISK PACING: Start scenes in action. Maintain momentum. Cut any description that doesn't advance plot or reveal character.
- DESCRIPTION BALANCE: Follow a 30/70 ratio - maximum 30% description, minimum 70% action/dialogue/progression.
- ECONOMY OF LANGUAGE: Every sentence must earn its place. If it can be cut without losing meaning, cut it.

NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE REQUIREMENTS:
- POV CONSISTENCY: Maintain a single point of view per scene. No head-hopping.
- POV FILTERING: All descriptions must be filtered through the POV character's perspective, knowledge, and emotional state.
- SCENE OPENING: Clearly establish the POV character within the first paragraph of each scene.
- LIMITED OMNISCIENCE: The narrator can only know what the POV character knows, sees, feels, or reasonably infers.

GENRE: {{ genre }}
TONE: {{ tone }}

Your task is to synthesize all of this information into clear, actionable writing instructions that will guide the writing of every scene in this book. Focus on:

1. The specific narrative voice and perspective to use (maintaining single POV per scene)
2. How to handle descriptions (sparse metaphors, concrete imagery, sensory focus)
3. Dialogue conventions and character voice patterns
4. Pacing and rhythm guidelines (emphasize forward momentum)
5. The emotional atmosphere to maintain
6. Specific techniques unique to {% if author %}{{ author }}'s style and {% endif %}the {{ genre }} genre
7. How to balance {{ tone }} elements throughout scenes
8. Any recurring motifs or thematic elements to weave in

Remember: Every instruction should support brisk pacing, metaphor restraint, and POV consistency

Create a coherent guide that explains HOW to write this story, not WHAT happens in it. The instructions should be specific enough that any scene written following them will feel consistent with the overall style and tone.

Format your response as clear, practical guidance that can be followed when writing each scene. Be specific and avoid generic writing advice.
