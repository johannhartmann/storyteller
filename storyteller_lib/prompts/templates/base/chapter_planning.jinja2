STORY PHASES TO COVER:

IMPORTANT: Distribute your chapters to properly cover each phase described above according to the {{ narrative_structure | replace('_', ' ') | title }} structure.

And these characters:

{{ characters }}

Create a plan for {{ target_chapters }} chapters ({% if flexibility %}with flexibility of Â±{{ flexibility }} chapters if needed{% endif %}) that cover the entire story arc for this {{ tone }} {{ genre }} story.
The narrative structure is: {{ narrative_structure | replace('_', ' ') | title }}
{% if min_chapters %}IMPORTANT: THERE SHOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN {{ min_chapters }} CHAPTERS to properly develop the story.{% endif %}

For each chapter, provide:
1. Chapter number and title
2. A summary of major events (200-300 words)
3. Which characters appear and how they develop
4. IMPORTANT: Create 3-6 key scenes per chapter (NEVER less than 3, aim for 4-5 for good pacing). For each scene, specify:
   - Detailed summary: A comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary of ONLY what happens in THIS specific scene. Be very clear about the scene boundaries - what starts this scene, what happens during it, and where it ends. DO NOT include events from other scenes
   - Scene type: Choose from (action, dialogue, exploration, revelation, character_moment, transition, conflict, resolution)
   - POV character: Which character's perspective this scene is told from (must be one of the required characters)
   - Location: Where this scene takes place (can be general like "A church" or specific like "The main cathedral's choir room" - specifics can be refined later)
   - Plot progressions: What key plot points are revealed/advanced (e.g., "hero_learns_about_quest", "villain_revealed")
   - Character learns: List what characters learn, formatted as "CharacterName: what they learn"
   - Required characters: Which characters MUST appear
   - Forbidden repetitions: What plot points must NOT be repeated from earlier scenes
   - Dramatic purpose: The scene's role (setup, rising_action, climax, falling_action, resolution)
   - Emotional tone: Describe the scene's emotional quality (e.g., romantic, suspenseful, comedic, contemplative, tense)
   - Ends with: How the scene concludes (genre-appropriate options like cliffhanger, emotional_beat, quiet_moment, revelation, transition)
   - Connects to next: How this scene leads into the next one
5. Any major revelations or plot twists

CRITICAL: Be very specific about plot progressions. Instead of generic descriptions like "character development", use specific keys like:
- "felix_learns_pen_missing" (not just "plot introduction")
- "hero_accepts_quest" (not just "character decision")
- "mentor_reveals_secret" (not just "revelation")

This specificity prevents repetition and ensures proper story progression.

SCENE SUMMARY REQUIREMENTS:
- Each scene summary must be 3-5 complete sentences
- Clearly state what triggers the scene to begin
- Detail the main action/dialogue/events that occur
- Specify exactly where this scene ends
- NEVER include events from the next scene
- Be specific about what characters do and say
- Focus on THIS scene only - subsequent scenes will handle their own events

Ensure the chapters flow logically and maintain the narrative arc.

CHAPTER PLANNING GUIDELINES:
- Balance action and character development
- Ensure each chapter advances the plot
- Include both major and minor conflicts
- Build tension progressively
- Plant setups for later payoffs
- Vary chapter focus and pacing

DRAMATIC FLOW GUIDELINES:
- Each scene should have a clear dramatic purpose in the chapter's arc
- Tension should generally rise toward chapter climax, then resolve
- Scene breaks should be motivated by dramatic shifts, not arbitrary divisions
- Use hard breaks (new scenes) for major shifts in tension, time, or location
- Use soft transitions when dramatic purpose continues
- Cliffhangers should appear at strategic points, not every scene
- Consider merging scenes that share the same dramatic purpose and tension level

{% if chapter_distribution %}
STRUCTURE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
Distribute chapters according to this structure:
{% for section, count in chapter_distribution.items() %}
- {{ section }}: {{ count }} chapters
{% endfor %}

{% if narrative_structure == "hero_journey" %}
Ensure each phase of the hero's journey is properly represented.
{% elif narrative_structure == "three_act" %}
Maintain proper pacing with setup, confrontation, and resolution.
{% elif narrative_structure == "kishotenketsu" %}
Remember: the 'ten' (twist) should recontextualize, not create conflict.
{% elif narrative_structure == "in_medias_res" %}
Clearly mark flashback chapters vs. present action chapters.
{% elif narrative_structure == "circular" %}
Ensure the final chapters mirror the opening with transformation.
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

Adapt the chapter distribution to best serve your story while maintaining proper pacing and development.
