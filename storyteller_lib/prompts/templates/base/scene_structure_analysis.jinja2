{# Base template for scene structure analysis #}
Analyze the structure of this complete scene:

{{ scene_excerpt }}

Identify:
1. How the scene opens (action, dialogue, description, or internal thought)
2. The main events that occur in order (be specific but concise)
3. The type of climax or high point
4. How the scene resolves
5. The overall structural pattern (e.g., 'routine->disruption->discovery')

Be analytical and specific about the actual structure, not the content.
