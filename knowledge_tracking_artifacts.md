# Knowledge Tracking Artifacts Analysis

## Summary of Findings

After thorough analysis of the codebase, I found several artifacts related to old or potentially unused knowledge/character tracking functionality:

### 1. **CharacterProfile Fields (models.py)**
The `CharacterProfile` TypedDict contains fields that appear to be legacy from an older tracking system:
- `known_facts: List[str]` - Facts known about the character
- `secret_facts: List[str]` - Hidden facts about the character
- `revealed_facts: List[str]` - Facts that have been revealed during the story

**Status**: These fields are still actively used in:
- `character_creation.py` - Default character templates populate these fields
- `database_integration.py` - Maps `revealed_facts` to database `revealed_secrets`
- `story_context.py` - Maps database `knowledge_state` to `known_facts`

**Recommendation**: These fields are still in use and should not be removed without careful refactoring.

### 2. **Dynamic State Fields**
Several fields are added dynamically to the StoryState but are not declared in the TypedDict:
- `scene_elements` - Added in `scene_brainstorm.py` and used in `scene_writer.py`
- `active_plot_threads` - Added in `scene_brainstorm.py` and used in `scene_writer.py`
- `last_node` - Added in various nodes for tracking workflow

**Status**: These are actively used for passing temporary data between nodes.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding these to the StoryState TypedDict for better type safety.

### 3. **Memory System References**
Found references to `character_memory` namespace in `constants.py`:
```python
class MemoryNamespaces:
    CHARACTER = "character_memory"
```

**Status**: This appears to be part of the active memory system.

### 4. **Database Knowledge Tracking**
The database has proper knowledge tracking through:
- `character_knowledge` table - Tracks what characters learn
- `plot_progressions` table - Tracks plot developments
- Character state tracking at scene level

**Status**: This is the current active system and works well.

## Conclusion

The main artifacts are:
1. The `known_facts`, `secret_facts`, and `revealed_facts` fields in CharacterProfile which represent an older approach but are still used
2. Dynamic state fields that should be properly declared

The new plot progression and character knowledge tracking system (using `plot_progressions` table and simplified `character_learns` list) is properly implemented and doesn't conflict with these older systems.

## Recommendations

1. **Don't remove** the fact fields from CharacterProfile yet - they're still used
2. **Consider adding** the dynamic fields to StoryState TypedDict:
   ```python
   scene_elements: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]  # Temporary scene brainstorming
   active_plot_threads: Optional[List[Dict]]  # Current plot threads
   last_node: Optional[str]  # Workflow tracking
   ```
3. The new plot progression tracking system is working alongside the older systems without conflicts
