# The Scene Guidance Process in StoryCraft

## The Journey of a Scene

In StoryCraft, scene creation is a guided journey that transforms a basic outline into a rich, detailed narrative. This document explains the process flow of how scene guidance works.

## 1. Understanding the Story Context

Before a scene can be written, the system needs to understand where we are in the story:

- **What came before?** Previous chapters and scenes provide context
- **Where are we now?** Current chapter and scene position (beginning, middle, or end)
- **Who's involved?** Characters likely to appear in this scene
- **What's the world like?** Relevant worldbuilding elements

## 2. Gathering Creative Elements

The system then collects creative elements to enrich the scene:

- **Brainstormed ideas** specific to this scene
- **Plot threads** that need to be advanced
- **Mysteries** that need clues
- **Character arcs** that need development

## 3. Crafting Specialized Guidance

Multiple specialized guidance components are created to shape different aspects of the scene:

- **Pacing guidance** - How fast or slow should this scene move?
- **Dialogue guidance** - How should characters speak to each other?
- **Emotional guidance** - What feelings should be explored?
- **Worldbuilding guidance** - Which aspects of the world should be highlighted?
- **Consistency guidance** - How to maintain character and plot consistency
- **Variation guidance** - How to avoid repetition from previous scenes

## 4. Translating for the Target Language

If the story is being written in a non-English language:

- All guidance is first prepared in English
- Then the entire guidance package is translated to the target language
- This creates an immersive language context for the AI

## 5. Writing the Scene

With comprehensive guidance in place, the AI writes the scene:

- Following the tone and style requirements
- Incorporating creative elements
- Advancing plot threads
- Developing characters
- Maintaining consistency with previous content

## 6. Reflection and Revision

After the scene is written, the system:

- Analyzes the scene for quality and consistency
- Identifies any issues that need to be addressed
- Revises the scene if necessary

## The Guidance Ecosystem

Each type of guidance serves a specific purpose in the scene creation process:

### Pacing Guidance
Controls the rhythm and flow of the scene. Fast-paced for action, slower for emotional moments or worldbuilding.

### Dialogue Guidance
Ensures characters speak in their own distinct voices, with dialogue that reveals character and advances the plot.

### Emotional Guidance
Helps create emotional depth by connecting external events to characters' internal experiences.

### Worldbuilding Guidance
Weaves relevant aspects of the world into the scene, making the setting come alive.

### Plot Thread Guidance
Ensures that important story threads are advanced in a natural way.

### Showing vs. Telling Guidance
Encourages vivid, sensory descriptions rather than simple statements.

### Consistency Guidance
Maintains character traits, relationships, and plot elements established in previous scenes.

### Variation Guidance
Prevents repetitive language, descriptions, or character actions.

## The Result

This comprehensive guidance system creates scenes that are:

- Engaging and well-paced
- Rich in character development
- Consistent with the established world and story
- Stylistically appropriate for the genre and tone
- Advancing the overall narrative

By providing detailed guidance rather than vague instructions, StoryCraft helps the AI create scenes that feel purposeful, cohesive, and emotionally resonant.
