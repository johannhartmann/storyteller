# Character Knowledge Tracking Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully unified the two parallel character knowledge tracking systems into a single, database-driven approach using the `character_knowledge` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CharacterKnowledgeManager (`character_knowledge_manager.py`)
- Centralized API for all character knowledge operations
- Methods for adding, retrieving, and revealing knowledge
- Supports visibility levels: 'public', 'secret', 'revealed'
- Integrates seamlessly with existing database structure

### 2. Updated Data Models (`models.py`)
- Removed `known_facts`, `secret_facts`, `revealed_facts` from CharacterProfile TypedDict
- Simplified merge_characters function to only handle remaining fields
- Character knowledge is now exclusively tracked in the database

### 3. Refactored Character Creation (`character_creation.py`)
- Removed fact fields from DEFAULT_CHARACTERS templates
- Added DEFAULT_CHARACTER_KNOWLEDGE dictionary for initial knowledge
- Updated create_characters to use CharacterKnowledgeManager for storing initial knowledge
- Removed fact fields from CharacterProfile Pydantic model

### 4. Updated Database Integration (`database_integration.py`)
- Removed mapping of known_facts → knowledge_state
- Removed mapping of revealed_facts → revealed_secrets
- Added get_scene_id() helper method for retrieving scene IDs
- Simplified character state updates

### 5. Modified Story Context (`story_context.py`)
- Updated get_character_context to query character_knowledge table
- Removed reliance on deprecated knowledge_state field
- Now properly filters knowledge by visibility (excludes secrets)

### 6. Database Schema Updates
- Updated schema.sql to remove knowledge_state and revealed_secrets columns
- Created migration guide (schema_migration.sql) for existing databases
- Character knowledge now exclusively uses character_knowledge table

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All character knowledge is in the `character_knowledge` table
2. **Better Granularity**: Scene-level tracking prevents repetition
3. **Cleaner API**: One consistent way to track character knowledge
4. **Type Safety**: Removed dynamic fields, use proper database queries
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new knowledge types or visibility levels
6. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with plot progression tracking

## Usage Example

```python
# Create knowledge manager
km = CharacterKnowledgeManager()

# Add public knowledge
km.add_knowledge(
    character_id=1, 
    knowledge="Lives in a small village",
    scene_id=1,
    visibility='public'
)

# Add secret
km.add_knowledge(
    character_id=1,
    knowledge="Has royal bloodline",
    scene_id=1,
    visibility='secret'
)

# Reveal secret later
km.reveal_secret(
    character_id=1,
    secret_content="Has royal bloodline",
    scene_id=10,
    reveal_to=[2, 3]  # Other character IDs who learn it
)

# Get all character knowledge
knowledge = km.get_character_knowledge(character_id=1)
```

## Migration Notes

- No data migration needed for new stories
- Existing stories will continue to work
- Old fact fields are simply ignored
- New knowledge is tracked via the new system

## Next Steps

1. Update scene writing to use CharacterKnowledgeManager for checking character knowledge
2. Add UI/CLI commands for viewing character knowledge
3. Consider adding knowledge categories (personal, world, relationships, etc.)
4. Add validation to prevent logical inconsistencies in knowledge
