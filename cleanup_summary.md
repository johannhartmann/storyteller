# Old Functionality Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all old character knowledge tracking functionality and cleaned up the codebase to use only the new unified system.

## Removed Components

### 1. CharacterProfile Fields
- **Removed**: `known_facts`, `secret_facts`, `revealed_facts` from TypedDict
- **Kept**: `evolution` field as it's still actively used for character development tracking
- **Impact**: Cleaner data model with no redundant fields

### 2. Database Columns
- **Removed from character_states table**:
  - `knowledge_state` (TEXT) - Was JSON array of what character knows
  - `revealed_secrets` (TEXT) - Was JSON array of revealed secrets
- **Updated**: All related database methods to stop using these columns
- **Created**: Migration guide in `schema_migration.sql`

### 3. Code Updates

#### database/models.py
- Updated `update_character_state()` to remove serialization of old JSON fields
- Updated `get_character_state_at_scene()` to remove deserialization
- Removed all references to `knowledge_state` and `revealed_secrets`

#### database_integration.py
- Removed mapping of `known_facts` → `knowledge_state`
- Removed mapping of `revealed_facts` → `revealed_secrets`
- Added comment noting that character knowledge is now tracked via character_knowledge table

#### story_analysis.py
- Updated `analyze_character_journey()` to query character_knowledge table directly
- Removed reliance on old `knowledge_state` field from character_states

#### story_context.py
- Updated to query character_knowledge table for known facts
- Removed usage of deprecated `knowledge_state` field
- Now properly filters knowledge by visibility

#### models.py
- Simplified `merge_characters()` function to remove complex relationship handling
- Added `scene_elements` and `active_plot_threads` fields to StoryState TypedDict
- These fields were being used dynamically but not declared

#### Test Files
- Removed fact fields from test_database.py
- Removed fact fields from test_phase2_minimal.py

## Benefits

1. **No Redundancy**: Single system for tracking character knowledge
2. **Cleaner Code**: Removed complex JSON serialization/deserialization
3. **Type Safety**: All state fields are now properly declared
4. **Maintainability**: Simpler codebase with no parallel systems
5. **Performance**: No need to sync between two systems

## Character Knowledge System Architecture

The unified system now uses:
- `character_knowledge` table for all knowledge tracking
- `CharacterKnowledgeManager` class as the single API
- Scene-level granularity with visibility levels
- Integration with plot progression tracking

## No Backward Compatibility

As requested, all backward compatibility has been removed:
- Old fields are not checked or migrated
- Test files updated to not use old fields
- No fallback code for old data structures

The system is now fully streamlined with the new character knowledge tracking approach.
